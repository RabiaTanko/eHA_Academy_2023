        <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Good food—healthy, delicious, tasty, nutritious, satisfying—can also be simple food.
            And simple is key in college. Most college students are juggling very busy schedules including
            classes, homework, jobs, friends, family, sports, clubs or other extra-curricular activities. Adding
            cooking and eating into that mix can be stressful.</p><br><br><br>
        <h2 id="Lasagna"><em><strong>Lasagna</strong></em></h2>
        <p> It is a traditional Italian dish made with layers of pasta, meat or vegetables, and cheese, typically served with a tomato-based sauce. Lasagne can even be made with different types of pasta, including traditional pasta sheets, fresh egg noodles, penne, or even ravioli.</p><br><br>

                <h3><strong>Instructions</strong></h3>
               <ul>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and cook for about 3-4 minutes. Add ground beef and increase heat to medium-high.  Cook until the meat begins to brown, about 5 minutes.  Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and pepper</li>
                <li>Lower heat to low and add marinara sauce. If you want the lasagna to be extra saucy, I suggest adding more sauce. Let the sauce continue to simmer</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, stir together ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, egg, basil, salt, and pepper</li>
                <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions</li>
                <li>Spread the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking pan with 1/4 cup of the meat sauce. Place 3 noodles in a single layers on top of the sauce.  Spread each noodle with parmesan ricotta cheese filling and sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and meat sauce.  Repeat.  Finish with remaining mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>Spray a large piece of foil with non-stick cooking spray and cover the lasagna. Bake for 15 minutes and then remove the foil. Continue to bake until the cheese if bubbling, about 25 minutes longer. Cool the lasagna for 10 minutes before cutting into pieces</li>
               </ul><br><br><br>
